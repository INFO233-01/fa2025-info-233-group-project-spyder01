## STOCK PORTFOLIO BUILDER

**Stock Portfolio Builder (SPB)** by Spyder01 will help people build a diversified stock portfolio. The program is intended for any new to veteran level investors of the stock market. For example, veterans would likely use it to create a new diversified portfolio. A new investor may focus more on the statistics displayed about each stock while building his first portfolio.

**Stock Portfolio Builder (SPB)** works by asking the user for an investment amount and stocks the user is interested in. SPB will use the Yahoo Stocks API to look up information on the user’s stocks. SPB will display selected information on the stocks and individually ask how many stocks the user would like to purchase. The amount will be subtracted from the total amount and displayed after each input. After the last stock, SPB will display the contents of the stock portfolio and ask if the user would like to make any changes. If changes are required, a menu with options will appear to assist in changes to the stock portfolio until the user is satisfied.
