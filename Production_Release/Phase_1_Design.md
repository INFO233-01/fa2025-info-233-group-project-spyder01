### Project Name: Stock Portfolio Builder
### Team Name: Spyder01

**Stock Portfolio Builder (SPB)** by Spyder01 will help people build a diversified stock portfolio. SPB is intended for new to veteran level investors in the stock market. For example, veterans would like to see what stocks are being recommended to new investors. While new investors may like to invest in recommended stock portfolios.

**Stock Portfolio Builder (SPB)** will ask the user for an investment amount. SPB will then ask to choose between high, active, or low stock performance. SPB will display 4 stocks and their information based on the user’s choice. The investment amount will be divided among the 4 stocks. SPB will ask if you want the stock portfolio emailed to you, and then ask for your email.
