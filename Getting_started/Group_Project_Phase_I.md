ROUGH DRAFT FOR STOCK PORTFOLIO BUILDER

Stock Portfolio Builder by Spyder01 will help people build a diversified stock portfolio. The program is intended for any new to veteran level investors of the stock market. For example, veterans would likely use it to create a new diversified portfolio. While a new investor may focus more on the stats displayed about each stock while building his first portfolio.

First, the Stock Portfolio Builder will ask for the amount you wish to invest. Second, the program will ask for a list of stocks you’re interested in. Third, it will display statistics of each of the selected stocks. Fourth, Stock Portfolio Builder will ask for the number of stocks you wish to purchase and subtract it from the total investment amount. Finally, the program will display the amount of each stock and total invested amount in your portfolio.
